# ml-face-mask-detection
Face Mask Detection using R-CNN
A Research and Development project in Machine Learning. This project explores Face Mask Detection using R-CNN on an image set of classes, 
mask worn incorrectly, without mask, and with mask.

Goal

The ideal outcome was to confirm that an R-CNN model could determine if individuals in images had masks on or not as per interest in mask usage due to the COVID-19
pandemic. 

Implementation

For implementation the Python programming language was utilized through Pytorch in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
