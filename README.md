Face Mask Detection using R-CNN
A Research and Development project in Machine Learning. This project explores Face Mask Detection using R-CNN on an image set of classes, 
mask worn incorrectly, without mask, and with mask.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant data for analysis and seemingly
conflicting instructions about how one can best stay
personally safe. One particularly contentious topic
has been that of face masks. As mask mandates were
put into effect to help lessen the risk of viral
transmission, the question of enforcement arises. Our
focus is on how a CNN model can be used to detect if
a mask is worn, and then if people are wearing them
in an accurate, effective manner.

Goal

The ideal outcome was to confirm that an R-CNN model could determine if individuals in images had masks on or not as per interest in mask usage due to the COVID-19
pandemic. 

Dataset

The data set from Andrew Maranhao https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection
comprises 853 images belonging to three classes (with mask, without mask, incorrectly worn mask).
Each image has an associated XML file of training information for classification.

Implementation


For implementation the Python programming language was utilized through Pytorch in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
